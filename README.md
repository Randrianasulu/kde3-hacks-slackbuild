# kde3-hacks-slackbuild
Various kde3 hacks for slackware 14.1/2

Hacks/patches for compiling kde3 and few related applications under new(ish) Slackware (x86) - 14.1, 14.2
Patches mostly come from TDE

Compiler used - gcc 4.8.4/gcc-5.5.0 (might break with newer GCC).
Should be compileable with openssl 1.0.2 (so, konqueror will display new ssl-protected websites)
Not really secure!

Includes patched HAL sources, so automounting will work
