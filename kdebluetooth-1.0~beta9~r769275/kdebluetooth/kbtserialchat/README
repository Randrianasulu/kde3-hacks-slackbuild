This is supposed to be a demonstration program on
how to integrate a program in kio_sdp.
kbtserialchat handles the serial port profile.
It registeres a mimetype for this profile and associates
this mimetype with some uuid that can be found in
a supported sdp record.
This way, kbtserialchat is called, if the user browses
the bluetooth neighborhood with kio_sdp and and
clicks on the serial port service icon of some device.

The program will be call with an URL as parameter, which
has the selected bluetooth device as hostname and
various other parameteres encoded as url-parameters.
In a KDE program, this parameters can be easily accessed
with KURL.
