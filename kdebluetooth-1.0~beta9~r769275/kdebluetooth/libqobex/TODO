Global
- Check for error returns and recovery
- Test and verify authentication.
- Better MTU handling (max. MTU different from transports and
  optimum blocksize ... )
- confiure.in.in etc..
- How to code devices in the url? (Host is case sensitive now)

Transport
- Bluetooth (does someone have unused bluetooth hardware?)
- Ericcson serial
- Plain serial
- Async mode is not really async. If one obex packet can not be received
  at once it may block ...
- Remove QByteBuffer with something more intelligent. Is only used in the
  BFB transport ...

Client:
- Handling of put and get where the request does not fit in one packet.
- Error handling of packets that don't fit in the MTU.
- If we send an abort we wait for an answer, but this is not always true ...

Server:
- Develop serverinterface.
- Cleanup.
- Test and verify.
- KDE mess with fork
