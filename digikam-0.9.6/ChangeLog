	  branch : Important changes here :
	  
	  Image Editor usability improvements: embedding editor tools in
	  main window instead to use separate dialog.
	  
	  - Add new EditorViewStack which create a stack of widget to
	  display over editor canvas (typically the full image canvas or
	  the editor tool preview)
	  - Add new EditorTool QObject component. We will use this one for
	  each tools.
	  - Add new EditorToolIface which interface an EditorTool to editor
	  gui (EditorViewStack + right SideBar).
	  This interface plugin or unplugin a tool to editor. When a tool
	  is pluged in editor,
	  a new tab is created on Right Sidebar to display tool settings.
	  The tool preview is displayed instead editor canvas.
	  Some editor action still avaialble when a tool is pluged as zoom
	  in or zoom out for ex.
	  
	  There is a screenshot of new RawImport tool in action which is
	  the first one to be ported to EditorTool:
	  
	  http://digikam3rdparty.free.fr/Screenshots/temp/rawimport/rawimport5-EmbeddedInEditor.png
	  
	  The plan is to port all others tool used in editor, especially
	  all image plugins.
	  
	  TODO: finalize EditorToolInterafce to be able to use editor menu
	  actions.

	  digiKam from KDE3 branch : new tool to import RAW file in editor
	  There are 2 way to handle RAW file in editor :
	  
	  1/ using auto-gamma. User let's digiKam import RAW image using
	  default RAW decoding setting from config panel. An Autogamma is
	  applied to image.
	  This option is used by default when you open image in editor. Toi
	  change it, go to Image editor config panel and set on "Use Raw
	  Import tool" option.
	  2/ using Raw Import tool. In this way a dialog with all RAW
	  decoding settings and a preview of decoded image is displayed.
	  Histogram is available, and panning/zomming over the preview is
	  possible.
	  
	  Note: this Raw import tool is also available with Showfoto of
	  course...
	  
	  A preview of tool in action can be see on digiKam-labs flickr
	  photo pool:
	  
	  http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3097/2735517982_598f1e30c3_o.png
	  
	  TODO : * included all Color management settings relevant of RAW
	  decoding. display this settings if digiKam Color Management is
	  on.
	  * added a gamma adjustement with RAW decoding.
	  * removed Tools/RAW Converter (single) option provided by RAW
	  converter kipi-plugin which become obsolete here
	  (Batch RAW converter will still available). Remplace this option
	  by a link to Raw Import tool directly.

          fast tagging creation.
          - In this dialog, the rules are the same than Caption & Tags

          /branches/extragear/kde3/graphics/digikam/libs/dimg/loaders/rawloader.cpp:
          digiKam from KDE3 branch : RAW image loader : backport 8 bits
          color depth auto-gamma and auto-white balance adjustements from
          dcraw with 16 bits color depth.
          These auto adjustements are performed only if Color Management is
          not used with image editor.
          
          The color rendering in 16 bits is exactly the same than in 8
          bits.
          
          This is want mean than you can process speedly your RAW exactly
          as JPEG. Just set your usual settings in RAW dedoding and open
          your RAW pictures as well in editor.
          
          This is the same way used by LightZone pro software to process
          RAW file without color management !
          
          This way simplify the task in Raw workflow... and will be
          suitable in 90% of case. Color Management must be used in others
          cases...

	  Do not use QListBox to manage ratio comobox content. Just clear
	  it and re-add new item as well.
	  Roberto, in KDE4 QComboBox content is not drived by QListBox by
	  but a genric QAbstractListView class. It's more complicated
	  to reproduce your QListBox code with QT4. Code from KDE3 and KDE4
	  must be homogenous when it's possible. It's more easy to
	  maintain.

	  Note : if you call
	  ImageEffect_RatioCrop::slotSelectionOrientationChanged() in
	  contructor just after to have created m_ratioCB instance,
	  you don't need to have current code at lines
	  imageffect_ratiocrop.cpp::103-112. This will reduce duplicate
	  code.

	  What do you think about about?

	* digikam/timelineview.cpp, digikam/timelinewidget.cpp,
	  digikam/timelinewidget.h: digiKam from KDE3 branch : TimeLine:
	  Fuzzy Selection is now possible!!!

	  Before this commit, selection been depand of Time Units used with
	  time line. Each unit have a propers selection.
	  This first approach been not fine...

	  This commit only make the selection on the less Time Units : Day.
	  All others Units are updated accordinly.
	  There is only one Selection possible, not one for each Time
	  Units.

	  A fuzzy range date become when for a week for ex. you have
	  selected only 2 days. The week selection is uncomplete (fuzzy).
	  This is right too between week/Month and Month/Year Time units.

	  On the bottom of the widget, the complete selection is annoted by
	  a blue color in background.
	  A fuzzy selection is annoted by a light-blue color using a
	  drawing pattern.

	  In fact, this is the same concept used in KPhotoalbum for ex.,
	  excepted a major difference : digiKam can select dyscontiguous
	  range of dates (:=)))

	  Marcel,

	  i have working hard with algorithms used in this widget. I would
	  to have your viewpoint to be sure than all is fine with TimeLine
	  selection.

	  Also, the KUrl passed to digiKam search KIO-Slave can be very
	  long. I'm not sure if there is a limit somewhere in KUrl or
	  digiKam Search KIO-Slave.
	  In theory no (:=)))... If there is one, the DB query will fail,
	  that all (KUrl truncated).

	  now displayed on the right of album name.
	  If a tree branch is collapsed, parents album sum-up the number of
	  items from all undisplayed children albums.
	  Count of items is performed in background by digiKam KIO-Slaves.
	  A new option from Setup/Album dialog page can toggle on/off this
	  feature.

	  Screenshot of digiKam in action using this new feature can be
	  seen at this url:

	  http://bugs.kde.org/attachment.cgi?id=22233&action=view

	  Folder view witch supports this feature are :

	  - Physical Albums from left side bar.
	  - Virtual Date Albums (calendar) from left side bar.
	  - Virtual Tags Albums from left side bar.
	  - Virtual Tags Albums from Captions & Tags right side bar tab.
	  - Virtual Tags Albums Filter from right side bar.

	  Note: for performance reasons, Search folder view do not support
	  count of items. Search queries on digiKam database
	  can take a while and slow down digiKam reactivity. See B.K.O
	  96388 story for details...

	  digiKam from KDE3 branch : added a mime type pattern selection to
	  the Album GUI status bar to filter album content based on file
	  mime type.
	  Current options available are:
	  - All files (default)
	  - JPEG files
	  - PNG files
	  - TIFF files.
	  - RAW files.
	  - Movies files
	  - Audio files

	  This new feature can be used accordinly with the new Rating
	  Filter tool and of course the Tags Filter sidebar tab.
	  Of course digiKam remember MimeType/Rating Filter settings
	  between sessions.
	  A fresh screenshot can be seen at this url:

	  The first patch from Arnd was correct, except one problem: all
	  the showing of widgets works
	  by events, and obviously needs to return to the event loop to be
	  completed. I am not sure why it did not work as with Arnd's
	  version,
	  as close also works with a QCloseEvent. Strange.

	* branches/extragear/kde3/graphics/digikam/utilities/cameragui/cameracontroller.cpp:
	  digiKam from KDE3 branch : Camera Gui : always download the
	  current picture as temp file before to check
	  if target file already exist in target album. The advantage of
	  this way is simple. We can always show a
	  preview of picture from camera because file is in local file
	  system. Also, this way work with all camera type
	  (gphoto2 include).

	  Important remarks : The Remane dialog is provided by KDE api
	  (KIO::RenameDlg class).
	  - With KDE 3.4.x, this dialog is not able to display preview of
	  pictures properlly.
	  - With KDE 3.5, the dialog have been revisted, work better,
	  but sometime the preview doesn't work properlly with JPEG, and
	  PNG files. It's never work with RAW file.
	  This is duing of limitation in picture preview implementation
	  provided by KDE API.
	  I have not yet tested with KDE4.

	  Possible solution of this problem is to use digiKam core to
	  render preview. But we must fork KIO::RenameDlg
	  for that, which is a wrong way.

	  I recommend to post a new report in KDElibs to improve
	  definitivly the pictures preview implementation to
	  work properlly in all cases.

	  Fix problem that cached preview image is null.
	  In Qt3, QImage is using explicit sharing. This means any
	  operation
	  on the actual data of the QImage object will modify the data of
	  all objects, in this case, including the cached image.

	  This is indeed unintuitive, and the Trolls have changed it so
	  that
	  in Qt4 QImage is also implicitly shared. So this fix should be
	  enough for now.

	  trunk/extragear/graphics/digikam/libs/threadimageio/previewtask.h:
	  The JPEGutils used QImage::smoothScale to scale JPEGs. Remove
	  this call,
	  so now all scaling is done at one place.
	  Scale down only if the image is considerably larger (~ >150%).

	  Scaling with FastScale seems 5x faster (callgrind) than the
	  scaling with
	  smoothScale (takes 4% vs. 20% of the preload time). To me it
	  appears better
	  to use the faster algorithm, even with faint quality loss.
	  Note: this is not about scaling when drawing, but about scaling
	  when loading the preview.

	  The new LT is now able to compare 2 images at the same time. Just
	  insert some pictures to LT and set one on left panel and one
	  other to right panel using the thumbbar context menu. On the
	  bottom (status bar) there are 2 sliders to zoom independantly the
	  right or the left panel.

	  In a first time i have targeted to sync left and right panel but
	  its complex to do it if size of left and right images are not the
	  same.

	  There is a screenshot of LT in action at this url :

	  http://digikam3rdparty.free.fr/Screenshots/lighttable_v3.png

	  The LT still under alpha stage. there are some part witch are not
	  yet implemented/tested...

	  The Light Table is an image container witch can handle items
	  from everywhere on Albums library. Just use the Album Gui pop-up
	  menu to insert an item in Light Table. The Light table has a
	  thumbbar on the right. When you click on one item, it's displayed
	  on central view, where you can process zooming and panning.

	  http://digikam3rdparty.free.fr/Screenshots/lighttable_v2.png

	  Gerhard, this implementation is in _alpha_ stage, and must be
	  _disable_ for next 0.9.2-beta1 release. Paco and me we working on
	  actually. To disable it before to release digiKam 0.9.2-beta1,
	  please just comment the line 26 from digikam/albumiconview.cpp.
	  Thanks in advance

	  digikam from trunk : Important improvements here !

	  The zoom functions available on image editor plugins have been
	  completly rewritten. We use now the new common preview widget.
	  The plugins affected by these changes are Noise Reduction,
	  Restoration, Sharpen, Gaussian Blur, Hot Pixels, Infrared Film,
	  Oil Paint, Emboss, Film Grain, Blur FX, and Charcoal.

	  Let's me explain the difference between the old an new
	  implementations.

	  With old stuff, the zoom function is very limited :

	  - zoom factors from x1 to x3 with step 0.5
	  - huge memory allocation duing to pre-zoomed picture rendering.
	  - very slow.
	  - Can frozen the computer when swap is require (with huge
	  pictures)
	  - Effect rendering is computed on a redimentionned part of image.
	  It Slow

	  The new zoom function is completly different :

	  - Zoom factors from x1 to x12. Free value can be set.
	  - No more memory allocation. You can use it with huge pictures.
	  No swap is require.
	  - Zooming/paning is based on new common preview widget witch use
	  a QPixmap cache in memory.
	  - It's very very fast to change zoom. Can be done in live.
	  - Effect is computed on crop 1:1 image. render is more fast.

	  Note : the mouse handling to pan/zoom in preview pannel is the
	  same than Image Editor Canvas and Preview Mode from Album Gui.

	  With Urls given below, you can see the Sharpen Tool in action
	  using the new implementation. Note the new zoom slider on the
	  bottom/left of dialog.

	  http://digikam3rdparty.free.fr/Screenshots/digikam0.9.2-newimagepluginszoomfunction2.png

	  You will seen than it's now a real pleasure to navigate over the
	  image to test an effect...

	  digiKam from trunk : Image Editor : severe bug fix in canvas :

	  With implementations <= 0.9.1, the canvas doesn't work properly
	  using high zoom level (> 500). The real image <==> canvas pixmap
	  interface do not compute properlly the tile area values. This
	  provide a lots of "tile" artefacts over the image. Look the
	  example here:

	  http://digikam3rdparty.free.fr/Screenshots/editorhighzoomartefact.png

	  Note than these "tile" artifacts are not the real tiles of canvas
	  and of course not the JPEG artifact (the image is PNG in this
	  screenshot)

	  The new implementation fix this problem to handle properly the
	  areas to
	  use from the source image to generate the canvas pixmap tiles.

	  Note to users : i need your feedback to check if all work fine on
	  your computer (to be sure if my patch do not give side effects
	  (:=)))). Thanks in advance...

	  all the mask is blured. With the new, only the pupil pixels are
	  blured.

	  I have add a new "Smooth" adjsutment witch can control the
	  gaussian blur effect. The result are very nice (:=)))...

	  Question: I think than the "Agressive" settings is obsolete now.
	  What do you think about ?

	  TODO :

	  - make the Red Threshold setting more configurable using a slider

	  - give another slider setting to adjust the Coloring Taint
	  blending level.

	  TO STUDY : The content of the eye pupil is destroyed by the flash
	  light reflected on the retinal. Why not use a real eye small
	  pupil photo texture ? This tecture will be in black & white using
	  an alpha channel. We will coloring it using the taint and merge
	  it with the original image to remplace the red area... What do
	  you think about ?

	  Other implementation patched with this commit : now the image
	  editor plugin interface can render the preview in dialog using
	  the current selection and not only using the full image data.

	  - do not update AlbumIconView on every call to

	  digikam from trunk: new Slideshow Tool using Preview feature !

	  Hi guys, you can slide your RAW files very fast like this !!!

	  This slide show tool is a simplified version of kipi-plugins
	  SlideShow tool. No effect, no OpenGL. Just the image slided on
	  the screen.

	  But the must important feature is to use Image Preview : RAW
	  files can be slided and pictures saved by digiKam image editor
	  will be loaded very fast because we use preview image embeded in
	  IPTC metadata (that the kipi-plugins cannot do it).

	  This slide show tool run always in fullscreen mode. this have
	  simplified the common EditorWindow class implementation.

	  This slide show tool is available in Image Editor and Showfoto
	  instead the old one. Added it to Album Gui is not a problem. It's
	  very easy to add the right action on the main window menu.

	  Luka, If you want to do it before 0.9.1-Beta1, let's go to, and
	  close files #135655, #140303, #140304. thanks in advance...

	* trunk/extragear/graphics/digikam/kioslave/digikamthumbnail.cpp,
	  trunk/extragear/graphics/digikam/libs/dimg/loaders/rawloader.cpp:
	  Disable the use of the DImg raw loader when loading as DImg from
	  digikamthumbnail ioslave.

	  We are using KProcess for the raw loader and make two
	  assumptions:
	  - there is an event loop (not for ioslaves)
	  - the loader is not called from the event loop thread (currently
	  no use case in digikam)

	  The DImg raw loader is not needed - DcrawIface is called before.
	  So the problem of the loader entering an endless loop (because no
	  events from KProcess
	  are delivered) arises only if a file is identified as RAW, but
	  dcraw does not
	  support it.

	  - Factorize status progress bar from image editor with new
	  progress bar used in Album Gui.
	  - New common widget StatusProgressbar and StatusNavigateBar.
	  - Removing old IOFileProgressBar widget on ImageEditor.
	  - Add StatusProgressBar on left of Album Gui status bar witch
	  will show items selection informations from current album or a
	  progress information when user apply changes on items from
	  Comments & Tags side bar.
	  - Add StatusNavigateBar on right of Album Gui status bar witch
	  will provide a fine navigation buttons collection to change focus
	  between items of current album. This navigate bar is always
	  visible, especially with preview mode.

	  TODO :

	  - Report progress info to status progress bar when Batch Sync
	  Metadata from current album is used instead a Progress dialog
	  (me)
	  - Removing Navigate Bar from top of image properties sidebar with
	  Album Gui witch is obsolete now. This one will be only used with
	  camera gui.
	  This will simplify the source code from image properties
	  implementation (Marcel)
	  - Add a new option to show hide statusbar on Album Gui (Luka)
	  - Support status progress bar when drag & drop is used to apply
	  Tags/Rating on selected items of current album (me)
	  - Using MetadataHub class with drag & drop stuff (me)

	  Multiple selection for Comments&Tags right side bar

	  When more than one image is selected, comment, rating, date and
	  tags are
	  compared. If a value is different across pictures it will be
	  marked
	  in the UI (grey text). The user can change such a value for all
	  pictures, or leave
	  it untouched.

	  Additionally, there is a button "More" which allows a batch
	  operation for the
	  currently selected pictures, either Metadata->database or
	  database->metadata
	  (the latter only for multiple selection, for single selection
	  this is equivalent
	  to pressing the apply button).

	  Problems and pending tasks:
	  - test it
	  - the Image Properties tab currently still displays only the
	  first picture. It needs to
	  support a multiple-selection mode with at least the file system
	  properties.
	  - the "More" button may clutter the UI, better implementations
	  welcome
	  - in the navigate bar all four buttons are disabled. Perhaps hide
	  them, but without
	  making the whole layout jump (I didn't know how to do that)
	  - it would be nice if the number in "Editing 25 pictures" could
	  be bold, but KSqueezedText
	  does not allow rich text
	  - if a tag is added from IPTC metadata and newly created in DB,
	  it is unchecked initially in ImageDescEditTab. Need to debug.
	  - metadata update notification currently always reloads if no
	  changes are made, and does nothing
	  if modified. For multiple selection more refined solutions are
	  too complex. Perhaps it's ok like this.

	  way been wrong because it hardcoded directly on image algorithm
	  the indicator witch have a side effect on preview histogram!
	  - Now, the widget witch render on the screen the preview image
	  will render the over and under exposure indicator : advantages :
	  * preview is render more fast because the corrected image is not
	  recomputed.
	  * target image histogram is not affected by the over-colored area
	  depending of unde/over exposed pixels !
	  - Add 2 new buttons on the top right corner of preview area to
	  toggle on/off the indicators.
	  - Like the preview widget is common of all image plugins, all
	  will support automaticly this new feature. Thanks to C++ (:=)))

	  Marcel: we have a problem with multiple inclusion of X11 headers
	  in digiKam source code.
	  Theses one redefine 'enum' type (or something like that) and
	  broke compilation with final compilation option.

	  If you check why X11 header is used in digiKam core (excepted
	  with theme implementation) you can see one
	  X11 method is called to check if CTRL or ALT keys are pressed,
	  especially with D&D stuff. I think we
	  can use Qt API instead everywhere. What do you think about ?

	  digiKam from trunk : native support of JPEG2000 file format.

	  JPEG2000 is an advanced picture compression file format based on
	  wavelet theory. It support 16 bits/color/pixel, metadata, and ICC
	  color profile. Look url below for more informations:

	  http://www.ece.uvic.ca/~mdadams/jasper
	  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG_2000
	  http://www.geocities.com/ee00224/btp2.html
	  http://www.photozone.de/7Digital/jpeg2000.htm

	  Still TODO with this JPEG2000 loader :

	  - The JPEG2000 quality level settings is the same than JPEG in
	  setup dialog. We need to create a dedicaced widget settings for
	  each digiKam image loader (TIFF/PNG/JPEG/JPEG2000). There is a
	  file in B.K.O about this subject.
	  - YCbCr color space is not yet supported. In fact, because
	  digiKam support only RGB* color space, we need to have an ICC
	  color method to transform non-RGB* color space to RGB* using lcms
	  libary for all image file formats witch can do use it
	  (JPEG/JPEG2000/TIFF).
	  - Embedding ICC color profile doesn't work. It implemented but
	  something still wrong.
	  - JPEG2000 Metadata extraction (EXIF/IPTC) not yet done in Exiv2.

	  To packagers : digiKam have a new library depency : libJasper.

          built-in sRGB color profile from lcms. This will be enough for
          0.9.0. Paco, perhaps we must provide an option into CM setup to
          choose the right mode between "built-in" or "from input icc
          file". Krita run like this. - By default, using the CM plugin
          with RAW file instead Color correction dialog. Paco, in fact, I
          think it's a a non-sence to use ColorCorrection with RAW file. A
          common option in CM setup is certainly better than 2 separate
          options : if user choose "Ask when open an image in Image editor"
          option, well digikam will start CM plugin if the image is a RAW
          file, or if its JPEG/TIFF/PNG it will start Color correction
          dialog. - Fix Color Managed View (for Monitor) color management.
          In fact this mode do not work properlly before this commit,
          because the input profile is the camera profile. This is wrong
          with managed view : the input profile must be the workspace
          profile. This is why some users have reported a wrong color
          rendering if this option is enable. Paco, please let's me here
          your comments if necessary. Please update your TODO accordinly

      This commit check IPTC keywords contents to tag pictures in

      intrusive to database. No new tag is created.

      A second step will be done to create new tags if current
      keywords are not found in database. This way is intrusive to
      tags DB table and the implementation need to be checked indeep
      to prevent indeep problems. Still TODO.

      Note to digikam users: i need Jpeg pictures to test :

      - witch have been tagged using digikam and tags saved in IPTC
      keywords.
      - witch have been tagged to IPTC keywords using another
      application (linux, mac, win32).

      The digikam tags are saved to IPTC keywords using a separated
      '/' like this:

      Countries/France
      City/Paris/Monuments
      Countries/GB
      City/London/Monuments

      This is want mean that we can remove the external dcraw depency
      definitivly.
      digiKAm will build and install a 'digikamdcraw' binary file
      witch can be used instead 'dcraw'

      This way will solve all bug reported from users about
      uncompatible dcraw command options.
      When we want to update dcraw in digiKam, we just need to update
      the dcraw.c and test the
      compatibility with all options used by digiKAm core.

      To digikam team : please let's me here if this way is right for
      you. Thanks in advance.

      Cam GUI:

      Flicker was caused from two sides:
      - handling of signalChanged from RenameCustomizer
      and signalSelectionChanged from IconView was entangled in one
      method,
      slotDownloadNamesChanged. Splitting that up, no
      signalNewSelection is
      emitted any more in response to a signalChanged
      - Fast dis/enabling will create the impression of flicker and
      lose focus (127614)
      Only disable now when downloading.
      Previously, signalSelected -> getExif -> slotBusy (disable
      tab),
      when Exif is ready -> slotBusy (enable tab)

      CC'ing 127614 because this explains the reason for the reported
      bug, and
      because I removed the restoreFocus again, which broke keyboard
      navigation, but does not seem to be needed any more.

      View/IconView optimizations or bug fixes

      Problems to fix:
      - when removing many images with the tag filter, the GUI would
      hang
      Try with >1000 tagged images and filter with "Not tagged" - it
      took
      more than a minute with full CPU, now 500 ms
      - improve GUI responsiveness when selecting images in
      AlbumIconView,
      especially with key presses or keeping the key pressed

      Fixes:
      - use a QTimer to decouple the selection signal from
      AlbumIconView
      and setting the right side bar in AlbumView.
      Using 75 ms.
      - set a wait cursor when filtering large numbers of images with
      tag filter
      (here it is 500 ms for 1000 images)
      No cursor for small numbers of images.
      - emit a signalSelectionChanged from IconView when the last
      image has been
      removed (and no image is selected any more)
      - disconnect signalItemDeleted(AlbumIconItem*) from DigikamView's
      signal_noCurrentItem
      - when all items are removed, make sure that the contents size
      is updated (to 0x0)

      File Deletion handling

      After long discussion (#126874) and input from KDE usability
      team:
      - <Del> brings up the trash dialog with a "Do not ask again"
      - <Shift+Del> brings up the permanently-delete dialog without an
      option
      - there are hidden actions for delete without confirmation to
      which power users can assign shortcuts
      - the current setup option whether to trash or permanently
      delete is removed from the setup
      - it is kept internally and used for album deletion, see below
      - add a new setup option which is identical to the "Do not ask
      again" option is the trash
      dialog, so that this setting is reversible
      - added to AlbumSettings as well
      - in the AlbumFolderView, if deleting a whole album,
      only the context menu can be used to select a delete operation
      - Shift+Del is reserved for images.
      Here, the user can choose in the dialog whether to trash or
      delete permanently. This setting is stored.
      No "Do not ask again" will be available.
      - all subalbums will be included in the list in the
      DeleteDialog to make the user aware that
      he deletes them as well
      - fix a bug in ImageWindow slotDeleteCurrent with directories
      that contain a "#"
      - The DeleteDialog has now five modes of operation, see above.
      The checkboxes
      are in a widget stack, all the functionality that was there is
      still there for future needs.

      digikam from trunk : Camera Gui improvement : first approach to
      itentify the NEW pictures taken by a camera.

      digiKam now store in the camera XML config file the "last camera
      used date". Each camera are tagged with a date value between
      camera gui sessions if some pictures have been donwloaded to
      computer. If no images are donloaded with camera gui, the date
      is unchanged.

      In fact, all image dates in the camera witch are most recent
      than the "last camera used date" will be displayed with a little
      yellow start to indentify the most recent pictures taken with
      the camera.

      To use properlly this little feature, you need to set the right
      date in your camera !

      Of course, this way cannot be used to identify the images
      "already downloaded" from camera to computer. For that, we need
      to have a full camera activity log somewhere (perhaps using the
      digiKam database).

      I'm waiting your comments about to implement camera log feature
      in digiKam.

    * trunk/extragear/graphics/digikam/digikam/iconview.cpp: digikam
      from trunk : general improvements of icon view reactivity !

      This commit is simple : during items selection using mouse
      draging, it dispatch the current icons selection event only when
      user have release the left mouse.

      Before this commit the implementation sent an event when a new
      item have been selected during the selection (under the mouse
      draging with the left button pressed). I other word, the gui
      will recieve a lot of events to refresh the sidebar. This way
      decreased the gui reactivity when metadata/properties sidebar is
      enable. This problem exist also with the Camera Gui. The problem
      is more important in this case because the data exanged between
      the computer and the camera will be important to extract
      metadata for each camera items.

      IMPORTANT : I have tested digiKam Album Gui and Camera Gui with
      this fix. All work fine but i would to have a right feedback
      from the team before to valid this change for the next
      0.9.0-beta2 planed to september.

      Thanks in advance for your reports.

      digikam from trunk : improvement of camera interface :
      Restoring an old feature from digiKam 0.6.2 to upload pictures
      to camera.

      In fact the interface to upload into gphoto2 camera have been
      never removed but the interface with the new digiKam folder view
      have never written by renchi.

      All camera type are supported : Gphoto2, PTP, UMS, etc. This
      implementation have been tested with my Olympus C3000Z and my
      Minolta Dynax 5D.

      By this commit, there is 2 ways to upload pictures in your
      camera :

      - Drag & drop between digiKam main interface (or quesror if you
      want), and camera interface.
      - Copy and Paste like between digiKam album.

      Todo : add a new 'Upload' button on the bottom of Camera
      Interface. I need a feedback from user before to do it... This
      one is really mandatory ?

      Note : with Gphoto2 camera, check if the camera dirver support
      upload using the new camera info dialog available by Camera
      Interface Help menu.

	  Marcel, this bug is very important to fix before beta1 :

	  http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=130525

	  I'm very confuse about the comments into B.K.O. Why we have this
	  problem now ? I have tested indeep the JPEGLoader::save() method
	  in the past...

	  After to have suspected a problem in DMetadata/Exiv2, i suspect
	  now a problem with the libjpeg implementation. Perhaps the
	  record of the icc profile isn't at the right place for example
	  (i have already this problem with libtiff in the past).

	  Your viewpoint will be very appreciate (:=)))

	  digikam from trunk : thumbnail KIO-slave use now the IPTC
	  preview image to render thumbs on album view (if exist of

	  This way is very fast. If you take a large RAW file and convert
	  it to a new png in 16 bits color depth, an IPTC preview tag will
	  be created. This one will be used instead the whole image !

	  For example : I take a MRW RAW file from my Dynax 5D (3000x2000
	  pixels), and i convert it to a new 16 bits PNG file using
	  editor. The size of the target PNG file is around 27Mb. If i
	  take the whole image, thumb rendering thumb take 3-5 seconds on
	  my Laptop PIII-650Mhz. Using IPTC preview tag instead, it take
	  300-500 mili-seconds !

	  Note : IPTC preview tag embed a 800x600 JPEG image... This tag
	  is always created when a new image is saved in digiKam editor

	  Since DImage::RawLoader use an observer to get loading progress

	  Tom, please try again to use camera gui with your Fuji RAW files
	  (without updating your dcraw version witch unsupport -e option),
	  and give me a feedback.

	  Note that in this case, the RAW thumb extraction will be very
	  slow. To fix this specific point, i need to upadte umscamera.cpp

	  will fix it by a new commit after your feedback.

	  In any case this bug is not due to an error in profiles class

	  - new iccprofiles widget including cietongue view.
	  - all lcms call are wrapped this new widget. It's more easy to
	  control lcms errors.
	  - this new widget is based on the common metadatawidget from
	  libs/widgets/metadata (used to display Exif/Makernote/iptc/gps).
	  It's more easy to maintain and more powerfull (you can now copy
	  and paste ICC info in clipboard or send it to printer). in fact,
	  this new widget use the same look and feel than metadata view.
	  The Gui is homogenous.
	  - this new widget show new icc tags. This can be improved again
	  (need to lear lcms indeep).
	  - This new widget is used in the Color side bar tab and in the
	  ICC color profile info dialog. The code is common and reduce
	  duplicate implementations.

	  TODO :
	  - add icc tags descriptions.
	  - fix iccpreviewwidget to use the new code.
	  - cietongue widget must show the current loading information in
	  color sidebar (like histogramwidget does) instead the simple
	  label on the bottom. It's more clean...

	  digikam from trunk : new fast image preview mode embedded on
	  main interface.

	  - Separate Preview and Edit of picture. Preview is embedded into
	  main interface, Edit is dedicaced to image editor.
	  - digiKam album content area can be now toogled between the
	  current image collection thumbs or the current preview of image
	  selected in collection
	  - To toogle between these views press F3. You can also press ESC
	  to go out of preview mode.
	  - You can change current image preview using wheel mouse or
	  these keyboard shorcuts : page up, page down, home, end.
	  - The preview image background use the current color of the
	  selected digiKam theme.
	  - Preview of RAW files are computed by dcraw using -e option.
	  It's very fast.

	  There is a screenshot at this url :

	  TODO :

	  - Extract JPEG, PNG, and TIFF preview from Exif Makernote using
	  Exiv2. Need to adapt Exiv2 library for that.
	  - Loading preview image outside the main interface thread using
	  a new digiKam KIO-Slave.
	  - Moving keyboard shortcuts of preview widget into main digiKam
	  interface instance to share it with image properties sidebar tabs
	  - Add RMB menu in this mode or just a link to Edit current image
	  in editor. Need users feedback for that.

	  create a new one
	  - when camera interface is called via DCOP (probably from media
	  menu)
	  - call KWin::deIconifyWindow
	  - call KWin::activateWindow()
	  - do not compute image dimension when listing from a UMSCamera.
	  This is a _huge_
	  speedup, say 5 minutes to 5 seconds.
	  - do only compute image dimension if requested in UMSCamera
	  - compute image dimension if not yet done in
	  CameraItemPropertiesTab
	  - various speed and crash fixes in CameraUI/CameraIconView
	  - do not crash when the first item was deleted from camera and
	  then removed from IconView
	  - do not request exif for items which will be deleted
	  - IconView: allow to delay updating frequency a bit
	  - use a ched itemRect for CameraIconView. Its faster, but more
	  importantly,
	  there was a crash with a pretty long story

	  digikam from trunk : improving image properties restoration in
	  database using image metadata:

	  - Fix DMetadata method to get image Exif/Iptc tags properlly.
	  (With the old implementation, Comments from Exif and Iptc,
	  Rating from Iptc and are never checked duing a wrong validity
	  test - stupid bug)
	  - Now at startup, these informations are backported to database :

	  ==> Comments from JFIF section, or Exif UserComments tag, or
	  Iptc Caption tag.
	  ==> Date & time stamp from Exif dateTime tag or Iptc date &
	  time tags.
	  ==> Rating from Iptc Urgency tag !!! If you add new files in
	  your Album library, witch are rated using Mapivi for example,
	  digiKam items rating will be appear in main interface.

	  Nota : these updates in database are only performed to new files
	  :

	  ==> when all albums are parsed during statup (or manually from
	  Tool menu).
	  ==> when new items are downloaded using camera interface.
	  ==> when a folder is imported from main interface.

	  TODO :

	  - Performed a database update at startup when files are already
	  in database and when metadata have been changed outside digiKam
	  (using ExifTools for example)
	  - Do something with digiKam Tags, since they are stored in IPTC
	  Keywords tags. This is most complicated to do because there is
	  no hierarchy between IPTC Keywords like with digiKam tags. We
	  store only Tags name in IPTC keywords. I propose :

	  ==> to check if a digiKam tags name already exist in database
	  and taging automaticly item using it.
	  ==> do nothing if Tags name do not exist (no new digiKam Tags
	  will be created in database).
	  ==> If dupplicate Tags name exist in digiKam database (for ex.
	  Travel/City and Travel/France/City), use only the first Tag name
	  found in database.

	  digiKam Tags <==> IPTC Keywords rules is a complex problem.
	  Please give me your viewpoints into B.K.O. Thanks in advance

	  The ImageEditor can now access the database independently
	  from main view, i.e. also if main moved to a different directory.

	  - adjust ImageInfo to be more like a database item wrapper class
	  - add a method to ImageWindow to start it with a list of
	  ImageInfo objects, use this in AlbumIconView
	  - adapt ImageWindow to (optional) ImageInfo list
	  - adjust behavior of saveAsIsComplete
	  - add itemChanged methods to ImagePropertiesSidebarDB:
	  - one takes only a URL (no database)
	  - one takes an ImageInfo object (used by ImageWindow, full DB
	  support)
	  - one takes AlbumIconItem and -View (used by main view,
	  full DB support, optional future interaction with the view)
	  - ImageDescEditTab now works on an ImageInfo object
	  - add a copyItem method to ImageInfo as a wrapper for said
	  function from AlbumDB
	  - modify AlbumDB::copyItem to return image id of inserted image
	  - add DISTINCT keyword to second SELECT statement of
	  AlbumDB::copyItem.
	  With all of above changes, I constantly produced bug #113915.
	  I do not know why the SELECT statement produces (in my case)
	  three times
	  the same result so that INSERT complains, and I do not know
	  which of
	  my changes should ever trigger this problem, but the DISTINCT
	  fixes this.
	  If anyone speaks SQL, you might want to check my comment in
	  AlbumDB::copyItem.

	  Currently, the rating is not copied when database information is
	  copied (in copyItem).
	  Should this be done?

	  - Fix DMetadata method to get image Exif/Iptc tags properlly.
	  (With the old implementation, Comments from Exif and Iptc,
	  Rating from Iptc and are never checked duing a wrong validity
	  test - stupid bug)
	  - Now at startup, these informations are backported to database :

	  ==> Comments from JFIF section, or Exif UserComments tag, or
	  Iptc Caption tag.
	  ==> Date & time stamp from Exif dateTime tag or Iptc date &
	  time tags.
	  ==> Rating from Iptc Urgency tag !!! If you add new files in
	  your Album library, witch are rated using Mapivi for example,
	  digiKam items rating will be appear in main interface.

	  Nota : these updates in database are only performed to new files
	  :

	  ==> when all albums are parsed during statup (or manually from
	  Tool menu).
	  ==> when new items are downloaded using camera interface.
	  ==> when a folder is imported from main interface.

	  TODO :

	  - Performed a database update at startup when files are already
	  in database and when metadata have been changed outside digiKam
	  (using ExifTools for example)
	  - Do something with digiKam Tags, since they are stored in IPTC
	  Keywords tags. This is most complicated to do because there is
	  no hierarchy between IPTC Keywords like with digiKam tags. We
	  store only Tags name in IPTC keywords. I propose :

	  ==> to check if a digiKam tags name already exist in database
	  and taging automaticly item using it.
	  ==> do nothing if Tags name do not exist (no new digiKam Tags
	  will be created in database).
	  ==> If dupplicate Tags name exist in digiKam database (for ex.
	  Travel/City and Travel/France/City), use only the first Tag name
	  found in database.

	  digiKam Tags <==> IPTC Keywords rules is a complex problem.
	  Please give me your viewpoints into B.K.O. Thanks in advance

	  instead the internal name provided by old Exif viewer based on
	  libkexif.
	  - Capability to read metadata from CRW files (Canon RAW files)
	  - New class DMetadata to load/save metadata without loading
	  image data. Actually JPEG, CRW, and PNG files are supported.
	  About PNG (Exif and IPTC raw profiles generated by ImageMagick
	  are supported.

	  To support new file formats (like NEF, MRW, TIFF, DNG, etc), new
	  image file parsers must be added to Exiv2 library.

	  IMPORTANT:

	  - Exiv2 do not support yet gettext for i18n rules. All
	  informations in metadata viewers aren't yet i18n (tags name,
	  tags values, and tags descriptions)
	  - Any tag names use internal Exiv2 name, not the user friendly
	  text transformations. This point must be fixed in Exiv2 libs.

	  To 0.9.0, these tools are just metadata readers. Writting
	  capabilities (metadata editors) will added later 0.9.0. The

	  - in setLightness, the value range was -200..200, while it

	  With the current algorithm, even setting a gamma of 1.0 would
	  create
	  changes, (x / 255.0) * 255.0 might be slightly less than x, so
	  casting
	  this value to int would result in an error of 1.
	  I hope using the round() function is a correct fix for this,
	  at least the 1.0 value now creates a proper x=y mapping.

	  (actually uncompressed), i have limited to 3.0 the max zoom
	  factor. This is enought normally...

	  Before, Control Pannel dialog always displayed the image in
	  x1.0. Now, you can see zoom into the image all fine details like
	  JPEG artifacts or singular points (hot pixels for example) to
	  correct using image editor tools.

	  Here we are a screenshot of "Restoration" plugin to correct JPEG
	  artifact using x2.5 zoom factor :

	  cursor,
	  now that all operations are asynchronous
	  - split signalChanged from a signal indicating a change in
	  undo/redo status
	  (now signalUndoRedoStateChange)
	  - slots in ImageWindow and Showfoto are split accordingly
	  - isReadOnly can be retrieved from Canvas/DImgInterface,
	  no need to pass it all the way through signals.
	  Added appropriate methods
	  - add extra check to avoid reentrancy in saving. Just for safety.
	  - what was setModified(false) is now clearUndoManager,
	  setModified(true)
	  is now setModified and used extensively inside DImgInterface
	  - in slotSavingFinished, reorder enabling actions a bit so that
	  the loading call can start
	  from a cleanly defined state
	  - saving is not a modification; do not emit signalModified.
	  - do not reload image after saving. Added code to saveIsComplete
	  to do what is done
	  in the loading slots except for actually loading
	  - setViewToURL
	  - not reloading implies that undo history is kept over saving.
	  - Formerly, the image did not need to be saved when undo
	  history was empty.
	  Now, a point of origin needs to be introduced to the undo
	  manager which identifies the state
	  that is identical to the file on disk.
	  - signalUndoRedoStateChange gets a third bool parameter.
	  - do not clear undo manager in DImgInterface when saving
	  - call LoadingCacheInterface::putImage to put the image into
	  cache in ImageWindow and showfoto
	  - In Canvas and DImgInterface, both save and saveAs were unused
	  and untested. Marked as deprecated,
	  renamed saveAsTmpFile to saveAs.
	  - ported DImgInterface to new putImage and bitBltImage methods
	  of DImg

	  - group data members of a DImg object:
	  - metadata
	  - image data (null, width, height, alpha, sixteenbit)
	  - data pointer
	  With imaging operations, the first group is always preserved,
	  the latter two may change
	  - add a few private methods for often reused code
	  - add a private constructor which copies metadata, but creates a
	  new data buffer with a new size,
	  used by copy and scale
	  - add a putImage method which replaces the data pointer and the
	  image data,
	  used by DImgInterface and thus the image plugins
	  - add a stripImageData method which allows to "strip" the data
	  off, take
	  ownership of the buffer, and leave the image as null. Useful
	  for temporary images.
	  - extend bitBlt to support source coordinates, width and height
	  parameters.
	  - add some flavors of the bitBltImage method, all using bitBlt
	  in the end
	  - use bitBlt for copy and crop to eliminate all the code doing
	  simple blitting operations
	  - add some comments in dimg files
	  - add a method metadata(DImg::METADATA) in analogy to
	  attribute() and embeddedText().
	  Is a method setMetadata necessary?

	  - PNG is now the perfect loosless GPL photograph container,

	  The metadata are preserved using "Raw profiles" records in PNG
	  text tags. This technic come from ImageMagick tool and still

	  in PNG to respect PNG compatibility with others sothwares/OS.
	  Existing PNG Raw profiles are listed at this url :

	  http://search.cpan.org/src/EXIFTOOL/Image-ExifTool-5.87/html/TagNames/PNG.html#TextualData

	  - Now digiKam can display Exif informations embedded in PNG
	  files when a JPEG files have been converted to PNG using
	  standard 'convert' ImageMagick tool or batch convert image kipi
	  plugin (this one using ImageMagick) ! Select a PNG file from
	  your photographs collection, enable Exif sidebar, and ENJOY...

	  - With Image Editor, the metadata are preserved in these
	  workflows : JPEG -> PNG and PNG -> JPEG.

	  TODO :

	  - Add a conversion on the fly with digiKam camera GUI. Actually,
	  it's very easy to do JPEG/RAW -> PNG conversion with metadata
	  backup.
	  RAW Exif metadata can be get using THM files from USM cameras
	  (already tested with my Dynax 5D)...

	  - added enums in SavingContextContainer, add another flag
	  indicating whether saving is synchronous
	  - the format was passed as a const char* to the SavingTask,
	  because at the very end it needs it as ascii.
	  Now use a QString. Too long blessed by QString, forgetting old
	  C virtues...
	  - filter by filename progress messages in DImgInterface, so that
	  no leftovers can pass
	  - made ShowFoto compile

	  TODO:
	  - merge loading and saving into common GUI class?
	  ShowFoto is currently broken, just compiles, changes are only
	  to ImageWindow
	  Either port changes, or merge into common class
	  - test and polish
	  - connect abort button, add possibility to abort a saving

	  Nota : Now IE asnd showfoto are a large common accelerator

	  (just one keys is set to IE, and many others to showfoto).

	  libs/threadimageio:
	  - created files loadsavetask.cpp/h, moved all LoadSaveTask
	  code from loadsavethread.cpp, split declaration from
	  definition.
	  What was once meant as very lightweight container classes grew
	  into
	  full-blown implementations, so this split was overdue
	  - created managedloadsavethread.cpp and
	  sharedloadsavethread.cpp, moved code from
	  loadsavethread.cpp. This depended on the Load/SaveTask code.
	  - being a bit paranoid, fix a possible race condition where the
	  Load/Save event
	  might not be delivered after the second call of the load/save
	  function with
	  the same file
	  - a SharedLoadingTask now removes itself properly as a listener
	  from itself
	  as a loading process, so that the waiting loop breaks. This
	  was a severe bug
	  but had almost no visible consequences.
	  - add destruction of cache at program exit

	  HistogramWidget:
	  - Loading can now be fast. So avoid flicker.
	  In HistogramWidget, the repainting timer is now restarted to
	  draw calculation
	  message if it is not already running to draw loading message.
	  Previously,
	  worst case was a wait of 199 + 200 ms, now it is always 200 ms

	  digikam from trunk: threaded image loading

	  - threaded image loading
	  - add SharedLoadSaveThread class
	  - split declarations to different header files
	  - add LoadingCache class
	  - sharing of loading processes: if an image is currently
	  being loaded in another
	  SharedLoadSaveThread, a second thread will wait for the
	  first to finish
	  instead of loading it twice
	  - caching of images: loaded images are cached and available
	  to subsequent requests
	  This should eliminate any unnecessary work.
	  - Histogram tab
	  - adapt to shared loading
	  - remove some repaints
	  - painting progress message only after timeout value (100
	  ms), much snappier now
	  - fixed display of loading failure
	  - Image Editor and Showfoto
	  - adapt DImgInterface to threaded image loading
	  - add appropriate signals and slots to all three layers
	  (DImgInterface, Canvas, ImageWindow and Showfoto)
	  - split loading and saving functions in two parts in all
	  three layers
	  - for saving, some information needs to be stored across
	  asynchronous calls which
	  was previously stored in local variables.
	  Added appropriate members respectively SavingContext
	  classes (in ImageWindow, Showfoto).
	  - put in hooks for progress info display
	  - added preliminary code to wait on asynchronous saving,
	  needed for promptUserSave()
	  - added a modal progress dialog
	  - needs to be tested and fixed, see TODO below
	  - fix creation of ImageWindow singleton upon exiting
	  (checking for imageWindow() would create the instance if
	  not yet done)

	  TODO:
	  - add progress display to status bar
	  - disable actions when saving (all actions?) and loading (not
	  all actions,
	  e.g. selecting another image must be possible and abort
	  loading)
	  - test, think about and fix waiting on save() in
	  promptUserSave()
	  - more thorough testing
	  - fix a bug when fast switching through list in IE. First add
	  disabling of actions.
	  - still some debug statements active

	  digikam from trunk : simplify and fix dirty image flag if
	  current image has changed. Removed m_dirtyImage flag witch
	  cannot be use properly with any flag event from canvas (race
	  condition). Sometimes IE/showfoto said if user want saving
	  current image more than one time...

	  To the team : I have checked indeep all cases in IE and showfoto
	  when current image is changed and with all user interactions :
	  - changing current image;
	  - save and saveas;
	  - removing current image;
	  - Loading images/folder (showfoto)

	  All seam to work fine now. Please, check if all working fine for
	  you. If yes, this commit must be backported to stable...

	  Digikam from trunk : and finally RAW file decoding settings are
	  now used by IE and Showfoto...

	  Actually, the RAW file decoding settings implementation provide
	  these parameters :

	  - Enable Quality Decoding (bool) : If disable, we using old
	  dcraw command line syntax with '-q' parameter alone. If Enable
	  we using addition quality factor require by last dcraw release.
	  - Quality Decoding Factor (int 0-4) : The famous factor using to
	  optimize RAW decoding image (0 for slow computer, 3 for speed
	  computer)

	  TO DIGIKAM TEAM :

	  - I have tested using this implementation using dcraw v7.49, not
	  the last one released by Dave Coffin.
	  - We can add any other advanced RAW decoding parameter on
	  settings dialog tab :
	  * -f : Interpolate RGB as four colors. This blurs the image a
	  little, but it eliminates false 2x2 mesh patterns.
	  * -a : Automatic color balance. The default is to use a fixed
	  color balance based on a white card photographed in sunlight.
	  * -w : Use the color balance specified by the camera. If this
	  can't be found, dcraw prints a warning and reverts to the
	  default.
	  * -n : By default, dcraw clips all colors to prevent pink
	  hues in the highlights. Combine this option with -b 0.25 to
	  leave the image data completely unclipped.
	  * -j : For Fuji Super CCD cameras, show the image tilted 45
	  degrees so that each output pixel corresponds to one raw pixel.
	  * -s : For Fuji Super CCD SR cameras, use the secondary
	  sensors, in effect underexposing the image by four stops to
	  reveal detail in the highlights. For all other cameras, -j and
	  -s are silently ignored.

	  Notes :

	  - "-a" and "-w" are always actually enable on the current
	  implementation and work fine. I'm not sure if ti's a good idea
	  to disable these parameters.
	  - I have never tested "-f" parameter. I think this one must be
	  availabe in setup.
	  - "-n", "-j", and "-s" are indeep settings. i'm not favorable to
	  add these options, excepted if any users want these parameters...

	  Please let's me hear if all is right for you ! Suggestions and
	  wishes are welcome

	  This implementation use a new class from digiKam core library

	  operations on image files. This class has been written by Marcel
	  Wiesweg.

	  In first, i have use this class to perform loading image on main
	  window histogram sidebar tab. The old implementation performed
	  loading in GUI thread that generated any time latency.
	  Now loading operations are separated and GUI isn't frozen.

	  TODO :

	  - To load RAW files DImg image loader use parce.c implementation
	  from dcraw project. This source code using a lot of 'printf' to
	  debug. This is wrong and generate any time latency problem. We
	  need to fix it in the future, especially to port dcraw code to a
	  dedicaced pure C++ class.
	  - Add progress to DImg image loader.
	  - Fix DImg image loader implementation to break an image io
	  currently performed.
	  - Add thread image io support in Image editor Canvas.
	  - Add progress indicator in Image Editor canvas. We no need to
	  use a progress bar here, just a text indicator in percent placed
	  at canvas center. Like this, image editor layout isn't broken.

	  Thanks to Marcel to help me in these task !

	  digikam meets Rating. Now it is possible to rate your images.
	  The initial patch was sent a couple of months ago to the
	  mailinglist by Owen Hirst. I removed the dust, ported to 0.9.0
	  layout and added the possibility to make a search based on the
	  rating. You can sort on the rating and you can turn it off in
	  the settings.

	  methods in DImg to get embedded thumnail in image if available
	  (PNG, TIFF, JPEG, etc...) instead to load the entire image.
	  Sure, image must have been saved including an embedded thumnail
	  and we need to add this feature in image editor when image are
	  modified and saved.

	  Big changes in digiKam.
	  This is the new code dedicaced to 0.9.0 unstable developement
	  branch!!!
	  digiKam users, please take a care...

	  Core:

	  ==> New image properties sidebar implementation to display exif,
	  histogram, and image comments & tags to the left of windows
	  using sidebar.
	  This way remove all image properties dialogs and reduce main
	  contextual popup menu (BUG 109096, 109817, 109992, 113103).

	  ==> New DImg framework to work "à la QImage" with image in 8/16
	  bits/color/pixel(BUG 103176).
	  The code is based on incomplete DImage implementation from
	  Renchi Raju. I had fixed and improved this one.
	  Native file formats implemented are JPEG, PNG, TIFF, RAW
	  (dcraw), PPM.
	  ICC profils and Meta-data are preserved. lcms is used to
	  manage colors rendering manually or automaticly (BUG 87823).
	  Now, There is a new digiKam depency with lcms.

	  Showfoto:

	  - Image properties sidebar support
	  - All images from a folder can be loaded at the same time.
	  - Add DImg support.
	  - Thumbbar moved to the left. Image properties side bar to the
	  right to make a consistant GUI with digikam window.

	  Image Editor:

	  - Image properties sidebar support
	  - Add DImg support.

	  PENDING TASK:

	  - DImg : add cache file method to improve loading
	  operations.
	  - DImg : add metadata transfert rules between
	  file formats.
	  - DImg : add native support of JPEG2000, OpenEXR,
	  and Krita file formats.
	  - DImg : add rules to detect camera type use to
	  take a photo and applying automaticly an ICC profil (RAW file
	  formats especially).
	  - DImg : add Load/save operation in separed
	  thread to unfreeze GUI.
	  - Image Editor : add progress bar during load/save
	  operation (depending of precedent point)
	  - Image Editor : add Events support between IE and main
	  window about comments & tag sidebar
	  - Core : porting all imageplugins to DImg and
	  support 16 bits images (actually only BCG tool is ported).
	  - Core : porting all image filters to 16 bits
	  (histogram, curves, color effects, etc.)
	  - Core : Saving digiKam comments in PNG & TIFF
	  files like JPEG.
	  - Core : Removed imlib2 depency.
	  - Setup : add new configuration dialog tab to set

	  o When a media:/ device is not yet mounted, it will mount it.

	  It is really difficult for me to test all corner cases. It would

	* trunk/extragear/graphics/digikam/utilities/imageeditor/canvas.cpp:
	  Patch from Owen Hirst to fix crash when histogram is visible.
	  The histogram thread holds a pointer to the image data. Under
	  certain conditions, for eg, saving of image and reloading of
	  image data, this image data pointer is invalidated. Since the
	  thread still holds a pointer to the invalid pointer and tries to
	  do calculations on it, the application crashes. Attached patch
	  deletes the histogram thread before reloading the image CCMAIL:

	  document must have a /** @file Foo */ header 3) You _must_
	  document a surrounding { file, namespace, class }    for the
	  documentation of inner things (ie. member functions)	  to be

	  Working towards the design mentioned in DESIGN docs (sent to

	  listing of files in album (using digikamalbums kioslave) * new
	  ImageInfo container as a replacement for file container   (See
	  design doc as to its features) * EXIF date (from DB) is the file
	  datetime

	  What doesn't work: * everything else :) * tag listing * tagging

	  plenty of other stuff (and it sticks closely to the design docs.

	  database.  - Put the lib into action.

	  Some of the todo's: - revert the file filter, we should add all
	  files to the db - make the thingie non-blocking the mainwindow -
	  make the check on startup optional - make a progress dialog -
	  replace kfilemetainfo to a call which only retrieves exif info
	  from jpegs - returning qmaps is not efficient, make them an
	  argument.  - some other things.

	  For now you will see some delay the first time you start digikam,
	  this is to store all missing images in the database.

	  * reworked the image painting routines:   - the painting is done
	  onto pixmaps tiles which     are cached   - tile size is 512x512
	  (surprisingly the speed of	 the scaling routines in imlib2
	  tends to scale     non-linearly, i.e. its much faster to render
	  one big     tile than a bunch of small ones). that's why such
	  a big tile size. at most 20 tiles are cached at one	  time.
	  - tile updating and painting is done on demand - expose,
	  paint, cache	  - fixes glitches in the painting  * minor change:
	  the blended color has been changed to a   shade of grey with
	  slightly more opaqueness. i have found   this color to be more
	  usable than the previous darker blend BUG: 91486

          (GammaCalibration kipi plugin removed).
        * cgilles (2004-10-11): Added 'Open in Konqueror' menu option (DirOperations
          kipi-plugin have been removed!)
        * cgilles (2004-10-11): Added digikamimageplugins tip of day if available.
        * pahlibar (2004-10-10): fixed recursive calls in the resizedialog which
          hung the app
        * jahrens (2004-10-09): Double click on a tag/album/collection opens / closes it,
          depending on it's previous state.
        * cgilles (2004-10-09): Update Digikam Splashscreen by Yves Chauffour.
        * pahlibar (2004-10-06): make sure that the messages from the kioslaves are
          i18ned. the translations are in digikam catalogue.
        * jahrens (2004-10-05): Setting album thumbnail through drag and drop.
          Setting the dropped image as the album thumbnail. If the ctrl key
          is pressed, when dropping the image, the thumbnail is set without
          a popup menu. Otherwise it is shown a popup menu.
        * cgilles (2004-10-05): Added new method for to get (X,Y) selection
          coordinates. Request for digikamimageplugins (Raindrop especially).
        * pahlibar (2004-10-04): enable tagalbums to be seen by kipiplugins. tag albums
          have a prefix "Tag:" in their name to differentiate from normal albums
        * pahlibar (2004-10-04): added option to not ask for confirmation before moving
          items to trash (off by default).
        * pahlibar (2004-10-04): configure.in tests revamped:
          merge multiple configure.ins into one. use pkg-config for libkipi and libkexif
          output clearly at the end as to the status of each of the configure tests
        * jahrens (2004-10-04): The album thumbnails are stored with a relative path in
          the db now. So the album thumbnail will be kept if the album is moved to another
          parent.
        * pahlibar (2004-10-04): put the fear of the lord in the user when deleting camera
          items. make sure that they understand the files are unrecoverable
        * pahlibar (2004-10-04): deleting items will either move-to-trash (default) or
          actually delete, depending on user settings.
        * jahrens (2004-10-03): Changed the drag'n'drop behavior when objects are dropped,
          so we have standard drag'n'drop behavior in digikam when the shift or ctrl key is
          pressed.
          - dropping images on a tag with ctrl key pressed
          The tag is assigned to the images without displaying a popup menu
          which asks if that really should be done (bugzilla #89007)
          - dropping images on an album
          (a) ctrl key pressed: the images are copied to the album
          (b) shift key pressed: the images are moved to the album
          (c) no key pressed: popup menu is shown, whichs asks what to do
          - dropping an album on another album
          (a) ctrl key pressed: the album is copied to the other album
          (b) shift key pressed: the album is moved to the other album
          (c) no key pressed: popup menu is shown, whichs asks what to do
        * pahlibar (2004-10-01): thanks to joern's invaluable contributions to digikam,
          his status has been upgraded from a "mere" developer to author
          also give credit to hans karlsson for the very cool digikam banner and app
          icons
        * pahlibar (2004-10-01): finish implementing the remainder of the camera interface
          features:
          - context menu for viewing, exif, properties, download, delete
          - new properties dialog
        * jahrens (2004-09-30):
          - Added an item ("Set as Album Thumbnail") to the context menu in the thumbnail
          view to select a particular image as the album thumbnail - to let the user choose
          his own thumbnails for the albums.
          - Furthermore I've changed the album thumbnail creation completely. The image path,
          from which the album thumbnail was created is now stored in the digikam database.

          To create these new album icons, the user has to browse through his albums. The
          first readable image will be used as the default icon. Then he can change the
          album thumbnail to an images he likes (with the context menu as described above).
          This is not the best solution to create the new thumbnails, but we decided not to
          add too much special code to the application which is only needed for the first
          run after an upgrade.
        * pahlibar (2004-09-30): some installations do not specify extern "C" in jpeglib.h
          which leads to linking problems.
        * pahlibar (2004-09-30): new icons for digikam. special thanks to Hans Karlsson
          for this lovely piece of work
        * pahlibar (2004-09-29): auto orientation of image using lossless jpeg operation
          implemented in the cameragui. on by default. customize in the advanced options
        * pahlibar (2004-09-28): use mime specific icons for camera items
        * pahlibar (2004-09-28): removed kioslave camera implementation (has been replaced
          with threaded version)
        * cgilles (2004-09-27): Added icon for imageplugins help
        * pahlibar (2004-09-24):
          - simplified camera gui interface
          - kioslave interface was getting too kludgy. replaced with threads
          - advanced options: currently implemented - file rename while downloading
        * jahrens (2004-09-23): added setIcon for PAlbum
        * pahlibar (2004-09-21): sync with libkipi changes
        * pahlibar (2004-09-20): use ktempfile to save the generated thumbnail (fudged
          from kio::previewjob) so that race conditions with other apps is prevented and
          also files are saved with 0600 permissions (closer adherence to fd.o stds)
        * pahlibar (2004-09-19): sloppy programming. forgot to escape the urls/filenames
          for the database query.
        * rytilahti (2004-09-18): save the splitter position
        * pahlibar (2004-09-16): Fixed crash when deleting files (this should fix the
         rename batchprocess plugin crash reported by gilles also). thumbnailjob was
         referencing a kfileitem which got deleted by kdirlister. couldn't find the exact
         place of the problem, so reverted back to using kurls in the thumbnailjob.
         - removed imlib2 loading of thumbnails, as some tests indicated that faster
         loading of thumbnails can be doing a png load directly into a qimage. code for
          that coming soon.
        * pahlibar (2004-09-15): sync with libkipi changes
        * pahlibar (2004-09-15):
          - move the deleting files from database code from the main app to kioslave,
          this makes the deleting file operations appear much lesser non-blocking
          - added code for showing the tag albums in the kipiplugins, but disabled it
          till issues with the imagegallery are resolved.
        * pahlibar (2004-09-15): strip off newlines from squeezed text. clears up
          rendering issues in the thumbnail view
        * cgilles (2004-09-13): Added Kipi version informations to the GUI (Digikam about
          and plugins setup)
        * pahlibar (2004-09-12): context specific enabling/disabling of album/tag specific
          actions in the menubar
        * pahlibar (2004-09-10): refresh album comments in the thumbnail view when album
          comments are changed using the album property editor
        * cgilles (2004-09-10): Fixed album properties dialog layout.
        * cgilles (2004-09-09): Added release ID header file
        * pahlibar (2004-09-08): allow addition of new images from external sources
          supported by kio
        * pahlibar (2004-09-08): polishing... one of the two views (left - tree, right -
          thumbnail) will have the appearance of focus. this prevent ugly focus outs when
          for eg, a context menu is requested on a view.
        * pahlibar (2004-09-08): don't stat if the src url is not a local
          file/directory. just pass it on straight through to kio::copyjob
        * cgilles (2004-09-08): Added PNG max compression when saving PNG images
        * pahlibar (2004-09-07):
          - moved out context assign/remove tags menu into separate class
          - now remove tags menu will show only those tags which have been
          assigned to at least one item
        * pahlibar (2004-09-07):
          - option to hide toolbar in fullscreen mode in the imagewindow
          - pressing ESC will exit out of fullscreen mode
        * pahlibar (2004-09-07):
          pressing escape in the imageviwer fullscreen mode will exit out of the
          fullscreen mode
        * pahlibar (2004-09-06):
         hide menubar & statusbar in fullscreen mode for the imagewindow.
         plug and unplug the fullscreen action in the toolbar accordingly
        * pahlibar (2004-09-06):
          create the toolbar with proper object name. dunno why ktoolbar took off
          the option to specify the object name in the constructor
        * pahlibar (2004-09-05):
          following a suggestion from mornfall, its now possible to assign/remove tags
          which have subtags from the context menu, without causing too much confusion
        * pahlibar (2004-09-05):
          reposition filetip after resize.
        * cgilles (2004-09-05): Fixed an i18n problem between the real ImagePlugins name
          and the ImagePlugins loading/unloading fonctions.
          Using now the libraries plugins name for the ImagePlugins setup.
        * pahlibar (2004-09-04):
          finally.... proper indication of which of the left and right view have
          the focus in the mainwindow. the view which has the focus is shown
          raised and the other one is shown sunken
        * pahlibar (2004-09-04):
          fixed restoring the position and size of mainwindow and imagewindow(previous
          commit) after fullscreen maximization
        * pahlibar (2004-09-04):
          fixed broken fullscreen maximization for imageeditor.
        * jahrens (2004-09-04):
          - minor drag and drop changes
           - disabled dropping an album to another album when in "ByFolder-Mode"
           - changed AlbumDrag constructor
           - handling dragging pixmap when no pixmap is available
        * cgilles (2004-09-03): Added missing i18n for entry menu
        * cgilles (2004-09-03): Fixed include header. Work fine now with
          digikamimageplugins cvs module (alone mode resqueted by Achim Bohnet).
        * cgilles (2004-09-02): Fixed header for digikamimageplugins building
        * cgilles (2004-09-02): Using KIPI icon
        * jahrens (2004-09-01):
          - album drag and drop
            - albums can be moved/copied in the album folder view through drag and drop.
              So albums can be rearranged.
          - albums can be dropped on a collection to assign it to the collection
          - Completely rewrite of AlbumFolderView::contentsDragMoveEvent()
        * pahlibar (2004-09-01): don't do the albumfolderitem open/close once the initial
          loading is complete. this prevents surprises during DnD copy/move of albums
        * pahlibar (2004-09-01): use digikamio for copying/moving files/albums.
        * pahlibar (2004-09-01):
          - app interface for digikamio kioslave: uses digikamio kioslave for
          file/folder copy/move within the album library and KIO::copyjob for
          external file/folder copy/move.
          - busyprogressbar: a progressbar which shows a busy indicator when the
          total and current progress is not (the progress bar shuttles from
          left to right). used within the digikamio app interface. can be used
          elsewhere
        * pahlibar (2004-09-01):
          digikamio:
          - new kioslave for file/folder copying/moving while preserving all metadata.
          - unlike kde file kioslave this can move/copy folders recursively
          - handles four cases of copy/move: a) album copy/move b) file copy/move
           c) external folder copy/move into album library d) external file copy/move
           into album library
        * cgilles (2004-09-01): Fixed slider/spinbox slots
        * jahrens (2004-08-31): Minor drag and drop changes
        * cgilles (2004-08-31): Added link to DigikamImagePlugins handbooks in ImageEditor
          help menu
        * jahrens (2004-08-30): Drag and drop improvement:
          An album is opened and displays its children when the mouse pointer pauses over
          the album during drag and drop.
        * jahrens (2004-08-29): Added an import option to import image folders as digikam
          albums
         - select the parent album in the folder view (if no album is selected root will be the parent)
         - Album->Import->Import Folders...
         -select the folders in the appearing file select dialog
        * rhoezler (2004-08-26): - "Correct EXIF orientation tag" now works on all
          selected images, not just the first one
        * pahlibar (2004-08-26):
         - if drag moves over an unacceptable position, remove the old droptarget
          and set it to zero. prevents surprises in case of dropevents.
        * pahlibar (2004-08-26):  as joern pointed out the drag was being called out
          multiple times. i turned on the contents mouse tracking for implementing the
          tooltips which led to this breakage.this commit will set startDragItem to zero
          once mouse leaves the widget
        * jahrens (2004-08-26): Dragging an object in the albumiconview can continuously
          produce new drag objects.
          1. Select an image in the albumiconview
          2. drop it on the albumfolderview or at the window title, so the drag object
           is destroyed
          3. don't press the mouse button and leave the mouse over the albumiconview,
           but not over an image. the image is still selected.
          4. switch to another desktop by a shortcut and switch back to the desktop
           that displays digikam
          5. a new QMouseEvent is generated. Since the mouse isn't positioned over an
           image a new drag object for the previously selected image is created -> bug!
        * rhoezler (2004-08-26): - Fix order of transformation during EXIF auto rotate
          Add missing "horizontal flip" option that was lost when moving it to the image menu
        * cgilles (2004-08-26): Add new cursor changing method for the image preview
          widget (using by the long preview process like OilPaint for to show a
          waiting cursor in the widget area).
        * cgilles (2004-08-25): Setup : fixed kipi plugins icon setup.
          ImagePreviewWidget : Added moved action between Pan icon widget
          and Image region widget when the selection focus have changed (thanks to Joern
          for this idea). The Image Region is updated but not the preview effect during the
          selection mouvement (only when the mouse is released). This way improveme the
          region selection choise in the original image.
        * cgilles (2004-08-25): Fix pan size for the large original image.
        * pahlibar (2004-08-24): fix a bunch of memory leaks
        * pahlibar (2004-08-24): fix memory leak
        * pahlibar (2004-08-24): enable ok button only if values have changed from zero
          state.some cleanup in hsl
        * pahlibar (2004-08-24): hide tooltip on mouse wheel event
        * cgilles (2004-08-24): Moved all Digikam widgets in /libs/widgets folder.
          Fixed Makefiles in according.
        * pahlibar (2004-08-23): warn users on an attempt to delete an album or a tag, if
          there are sub albums and tags. also show the number of sub albums and tags.
        * pahlibar (2004-08-23): use WStyle_Splash for splash screen. makes splashscreen
          hideable by clicking on it. added a new page to the setup dialog
          (Miscellaneous). added option to turn off splashscreen
        * pahlibar (2004-08-22): write comments only to jpeg jfif section. we want to
          reserve exif user comments for the Adobe XMP metadata (maybe)
        * pahlibar (2004-08-22): use kmenubar instead of qmenubar for the guibuilder, so
         that kde specific menubar settings (Mac OS type menubar for eg) is respected
        * pahlibar (2004-08-22): break lines in tooltip only at word boundaries
        * jahrens (2004-08-22): Tags can be dropped on images to assign the tag
        * pahlibar (2004-08-21): show filesize in both human readable form and in bytes
          change Date -> Modification Date
        * pahlibar (2004-08-21): use local aware date string format. break comments when
          too long
        * pahlibar (2004-08-21): show corner arrows based on position (fudged from
          kfiletip(libkonq))
        * pahlibar (2004-08-20): don't show tooltips if thumbview is not the active window
        * pahlibar (2004-08-20): loose the tooltip on focusout
        * pahlibar (2004-08-20): showing tooltips is now configurable. on by default
        * pahlibar (2004-08-20): show meta info also in tooltip (at some point we will
          have to make this customizable)
        * pahlibar (2004-08-20): polishing tooltip - break line between tags, don't break
          line elsewhere, strip leading / from album/tag names (albumfiletip.cpp)
          hide tooltip on mousepressevent on thumbnail view (thumbview.cpp)
        * pahlibar (2004-08-20): tooltips for thumbnail items
        * pahlibar (2004-08-19): use middle mouse button to scroll image
        * pahlibar (2004-08-18): assign/remove tags in bulk using right click menu
        * jahrens (2004-08-18): Added drag and drop for tags.
          - Tags can be moved and dropped on another tag inside the album folderview,
          so it is possible to rearrange the tag hierarchy.
          - When a tag is moved to another parent its children are moved as well.
        * pahlibar (2004-08-18): seems the last deselecting items when selection box
          changes wasn't completely correct. ctrlbutton-down-and-mousemove should not
          remove existing selection
        * pahlibar (2004-08-18): drag selection should unselect items outside the
          selection box.
        * pahlibar (2004-08-16): show an error message if exif correction fails
        * pahlibar (2004-08-15): set block size of gdbm file to 0, so that it will pick up
          the correct blocksize from the filesystem. prevents thrashing of the filesystem
          so much
        * pahlibar (2004-08-15): do the initial selection of albums/tags only after all
          albums have been loaded. last selected tag can also be remembered now.
        * pahlibar (2004-08-14):  dump and restore album tree state. remember last album
          opened (only physical albums, not tags - as listing files in tags requires that
          the corresponding physical albums have been loaded already and because of kio
          loading of albums, this is not guaranteed)
        * pahlibar (2004-08-12): added theme "Clean"
        * rhoezler (2004-08-12): Move "Set Exif Orientation" RMB entry to Image->Correct
          Exif Orientation Tag.
        * pahlibar (2004-08-12): changed version to 0.7.0-cvs. use kde b.k.o. as default
          reportbug option
        * jahrens (2004-08-11): Changed some menus according to the kde style guide
          http://developer.kde.org/documentation/standards/kde/style/menus/index.html
        * jahrens (2004-08-11): Changed the cameraui context menu to make it look like the
          albumiconview context menu.
        * pahlibar (2004-08-10): use exif rotation only if requested
        * jahrens (2004-08-10): Added a context menu to cameraui.
        * rhoezler (2004-08-10): Save correct orientation tag if image has been EXIF
          auto-rotated and modified/saved.
        * rhoezler (2004-08-10): Implemented EXIF-based rotation in the image editor via
          the Imlib interface.
        * jahrens (2004-08-09): Removed populatetags to rebuild the tag layout. Instead
          adding/removing a TAlbumChecklistItem.
        * pahlibar (2004-08-08): in thumbview, controlbutton + drawrubber should preserve
          existing selection
        * jahrens (2004-08-07): Context menu appears after RMB everywhere in the listctrl
          (imagedescedit) with root selected as tag when no tag was under the mouse.
        * pahlibar (2004-08-07): fix crash when requested texture width/height is <= 0
        * pahlibar (2004-08-06): enable editing of tags from comments/tag editor
        * pahlibar (2004-08-06): Compilation fixes in imagelevels.cpp. added new theme Marine
          improved Dreary Theme
        * cgilles (2004-08-06): Added methods for to load/save levels data values from/to
          a Gimp levels text file.
        * pahlibar (2004-08-05): add a menuitem to add a camera from the cameras menu
        * pahlibar (2004-08-05): moving to the first row of thumbnails using keys will
          ensure that the header is also shown
        * pahlibar (2004-08-05): bump up the version of the xmlgui file
        * cgilles (2004-08-05): Added Set/Get levels values methods.
        * pahlibar (2004-08-04): arrow in listview should use text color
        * jahrens (2004-08-04): Added a context menu to comments/tags dialog
          (ImageDescEdit) to add/delete tags. "Edit" is still unavailable, because changes
          made to tags in this dialog are not forwarded to the albumiconview. So I have
          disabled edit until I found a solution.
        * pahlibar (2004-08-04): digikam gets theming support. fluxbox style themes
         (texture renderer fudged from fluxbox code). themes can be installed at system
         level $PREFIX/share/apps/digikam/themes or in user home directory in
         ~/.kde/share/apps/digikam/themes. sample theme ("Dreary") included
        * cgilles (2004-08-04): ImageEditor: fixed disable menu actions when an image is
         opened from cameraclient. The actions are 'File/remove from current Album' and
         'Image/Comments'
        * cgilles (2004-08-03): ImageEditor :
          - Added config tab in main setup dialog.
          - New option: JPEG quality image during saving operations.
          - New option: background color setting.
          - Fixed TIFF saving operations.
        * pahlibar (2004-08-02): renaming of albums while retaining meta data
        * cgilles (2004-08-02): Histogram viewer: added drawing all color channels (RGB)
          at the same time capability.
        * cgilles (2004-08-02): Fixed AddImage method. Tested with BatchProcessImages plugins.
        * cgilles (2004-08-02): Added selection mode option in constructor.
        * cgilles (2004-08-02): fixed histogram viewer crash if current image loaded failed
        * cgilles (2004-07-30): Fixed histogram rendering in according with Achim bohnet
          advices.
        * pahlibar (2004-07-30): Fix crash when slave dies
        * cgilles (2004-07-30): Added wait cursor during image traitments. The calculation
          can be long if the image size is big.
        * cgilles (2004-07-30): Using ImageHistogram API in normalize and Equalize algorithms.
        * cgilles (2004-07-29): First import of autolevel correction class (adapted from
          the Gimp2.0). Added menu entry in ImageDitor for AutoLevel correction.
        * pahlibar (2004-07-28): added iterator for albums
        * jahrens (2004-07-28): Changed drag'n'drop popup menues to make them look like
          other kde applications
        * cgilles (2004-07-28): Added new common ColorGrdientWidget for HistogramViewer in
          ImageEditor and File properties dialog. Source code more simply...
        * cgilles (2004-07-28): Added new image Histogram tab in File properties dialog.
        * cgilles (2004-07-28): Added image Histogram Viewer.
          - New Histogram manipulation class.
          - New Histogram widget.
          - New Histogram Viewer dialog for ImageEditor.
        * jahrens (2004-07-27): Added drag'n'drop from external sources to AlbumFolderView
        * pahlibar (2004-07-27): Reorganization of cvs.
          - digikam/libs digikam/libs/guibuilder digikam/libs/histogram added
          - guibuilder code moved to digikam/libs/guibuilder
        * pahlibar (2004-07-26): added texture building routines (fudged from
          fluxbox). this will form the basis of theming support for digikam (around
          v0.8). use the texture routines to build base pixmaps for thumbnail
          items. currently hard-coded colors.
        * pahlibar (2004-07-26): when the native thumbnail loader fails and kde previewjob
          is used, the previewjob returns the thumbnail with fileitem. if the file got
          deleted in the meantime or the album got changed, digikam will crash as the
          kfileitem has been deleted and we are referencing a deleted item. solution: use
          kurl causing previewjob to generate its own kfileitem and on return use the url to
          find the item in the dictionary to assign the pixmap.
        * jahrens (2004-07-25): Adding a tab to KPropertiesDialog to show the extra
          information retrieved from the camera
        * pahlibar (2004-07-25): double-click/return-press will open up the imageviewer
          for the camera file items
        * pahlibar (2004-07-25): Disable saving of images when viewing a camera file in
          the image editor. User can still use saveas to save the file elsewhere. at some
          point, we have to start thinking of allowing user to save the file and the file
          gets uploaded back into the camera. maybe too much of a hassle for an
          infrequently used operation
        * pahlibar (2004-07-25): implemented viewing image
        * pahlibar (2004-07-24): - added: retrieve and show camera information
          (summary/manual/about). fix: the error dialog in camera window is now correctly
          placed over the camera window.
        * pahlibar (2004-07-24): slowly adding back all the old features from the
          digikamcameraclient
          - implemented getting exif information for a camera file item
          - pahlibar (2004-07-24):
          - if thumbnail can't be loaded from database, delete the key
          - safety checks: check if db is valid
        * pahlibar (2004-07-23): "instant loading" thumbnails
          - creates a database file (gdbm database) in ~/.thumbnails
          - adds a tiny low resolution (48x48) thumbnail for each file in the album
          that you browse to using digikam
          - on loading an album, this database is queried to see if a thumbnail is
          present for a file and if yes, this thumbnail is loaded, rough scaled to
          the size needed and shown.
          - the regular thumbnail loader runs in the background, as usual, and it
          keeps updating the displayed thumbnails, essentially smoothing the
          thumbnails.
         - result is that if the user visits an album which he/she has browsed to
          before, the rough thumbnail are shown fast and then the smoothing process
          of the thumbnails begin.
         - regular thumbnails are still stored according to the freedesktop standards
        * pahlibar (2004-07-23):
          - set the cursor to a busy cursor when loading images.
          - semi-progressive painting of the images when flipping between
          images. essentially what it does is splits the painting of the image into
          multiple small paints (stripwise). used only when loading an image and not
          while scrolling/zooming/... . scrolling through images should be
          non-blocking and seem a bit faster
         - preload next image (not really sure it helps since rendering is the
         - most expensive part and we do not do any rendering in the preload)
         - fixed a painting bug when resizing the selection with handles
        * pahlibar (2004-07-22): fixed memory leak which caused imlib to not free memory
          on closing the imagewindow
        * pahlibar (2004-07-21): Camera File Properties dialog a la KDE file properties dialog.
        * pahlibar (2004-07-21): implemented select all/none/invert for camera window
        * cgilles (2004-07-21): ImageEditor: Added new image colors enhacement plugin
          'Normalize'.
        * pahlibar (2004-07-20): two levels of redeye correction:
          a) mild - use if other parts of face have been selected
          b) aggressive - use if eye(s) have been selected exactly
        * pahlibar (2004-07-20): optimization for loading items in a tag (especially
          recursively). seems queries on sqlite when using JOIN tables is rather slow. by building
          the album list manually and then querying items from the tag table alone,
          the queries are much faster (nearly 10x speed increase). consequently
          listing of items from the tags  has a >2x speed increase (stating and
          listentry slow things down).
        * cgilles (2004-07-20): Fix RGB image plugin sliders (look similar with Photoshop
          and The Gimp)
        * cgilles (2004-07-20): Fix balance values for BCG image plugin (like photoshop
          and the Gimp).
        * pahlibar (2004-07-19):
          - initial version cameragui
          - merged back into main application
          - interface for interacting with digikamcamera kioslave in a
          - connection oriented mode
          - only download implemented currently
          - dirselectdialog (modified from kdirselectdialog) for
          - selecting/creating target album
        * pahlibar (2004-07-18):
          - initial version of camera kioslave
          - unlike kamera this is a connection oriented kioslave.
          - only download implemented currently. rest to follow. initial gui tomorrow.
        * rytilahti (2004-07-17): Check if the camera hasn't been added to the list after
          the last save. Also fixed some messages to
          KDE standard ones.
        * pahlibar (2004-07-16): improved the sepia filtering, using the hsl functions.
        * pahlibar (2004-07-16): included some utility functions to convert from RGB to
          HSL and back. Useful for plugins.
        * pahlibar (2004-07-16): fix crash in slotSaveAs. only try to write exif if both
          src and destination are jpeg files. also emit a signal to indicate that a file
          has been modified when saving.
        * cgilles (2004-07-16): ImageEditor: added new HSL balance correction plugin !
        * cgilles (2004-07-16): ImageEditor : Added new 'Free image rotation' option with
          dialog.
        * pahlibar (2004-07-13): keyevents behave more like standard listviews.
        * pahlibar (2004-07-13): emit a signal when a file has been added. tag albums
          don't update automatically. copy all the metadata when using saveas not just the
          comments. removed unnecessary double loading of image
        * cgilles (2004-07-13): - Re-enable 'File print' option from the old ImageViewer.
          This implementation is impired of Kuickshow source code and freeze the GUI during the
          printing calculation. I will push that in a thread...
          - Added Save and Saveas method in imlibiface.
        * pahlibar (2004-07-12): Sort Images by Name, Path, Date, File Size
        * pahlibar (2004-07-12): on initial display, the initial sizes of the left and
          right view are to be in the ratio of 1:2. sometimes these sizes were not set
          right. override the resizeevent to set the ratios correctly on initial loading
        * pahlibar (2004-07-12): fix importing of images. allow importing only if
          destination album is a physical album
        * cgilles (2004-07-12): Added Image comments edit dialog for ImageEditor.
          Restored the Image Comments Edit option from old ImageViewer.
        * cgilles (2004-07-12): Restored View Exif info from old ImageViewer.

          Removed selection parsing.
        * cgilles (2004-07-12): BCG ImagePlugin : Added whatsthis, help button, and Reset
          values button.
        * cgilles (2004-07-12): Added new ImageEditor plugin : colors balance (RGB adjustments) !!!
        * pahlibar (2004-07-11): shift-arrow keyboard keys will allow multiple selection of items.
        * pahlibar (2004-07-11): Make recursive retrieval a setup option
        * pahlibar (2004-07-11):
          - reimplement the item lister using pure kdirlister and use the new
            digikamtags protocol
          - non-blocking listing of items in Tag Albums from database.
          - Currently recursive retrieval is hard coded in by default.
            need to make this selectable in the setup dialog
          - use updatedirectory instead of reloading the items from tag in case
            of modifications. (more work might be needed here. maybe a kdirwatch
            to watch the items in the tag, as kdirlister doesn't do it for us
            thinking its a non-local protocol)
        * pahlibar (2004-07-11):
          -  kioslave to retrieve items in a tag album in a non-blocking fashion
            implemented as a virtual filesystem with tag albums retrieved as
            virtual folders. but the files themselves are listed as local files
            with protocol "file"
          - recursive retrieval of items in subtags (only if requested)
          - an important side-effect of the kioslave is that users can see the
            tag albums in konqueror. just type digikamtags:/ in the locationbar.
            by default recursive retrieval is disabled for external applications.
        * pahlibar (2004-07-09):
          In the comments/tag-editor Ctrl-Enter will save and move onto
          the next item. Shift-Enter will save and move to the prev item
        * cgilles (2004-07-09): Added new image plugins for ImageEditor : blur and sharpen
          filters !
        * pahlibar (2004-07-08): Use stdgui items for forward back buttons in
          tag-comments-editor
        * pahlibar (2004-07-08): Added a checkbox in the comment/tag-editor to
          automatically save comments/tags when navigating between items
        * pahlibar (2004-07-07):
          Large number of changes:
          a) interfaces subdirectory removed. some of the code moved to digikam subdir
          b) sqlite source code (v2.8.14) imported into a separate subdir
          c) AlbumManager/AlbumDB/Album (note: change in name from AlbumInfo->Album)
             rewritten from scratch
          d) AlbumDB is the new sqlite based database backend instead of the old xml
             style database. Old xml database will be imported automatically into
             the new database. No export function yet (do we still need a separate
             digikam xml format? we can think of exporting to some other app format,
             like kimdaba/kphotobook). Note: the old xml files are still retained,
             so you can safely run this new digikam on your existing album library.
          e) Album is an abstract class with derived implementations of two (currently)
             kinds: Physical Albums (PAlbum) - representing folders on the drive and
             Tag Album (TAlbum) - representing tags in the database
          f) Nested albums supported (some optimization might be needed for loading
             the initial list of physical albums). both folders and tags can have
             unlimited nesting
          g) Native light-weight implementation of a treeview to replace qlistview
             based treeview. this new implementation is flicker-free and has a cleaner
             look compared to qlistview
          h) Tagging of images added (you must have guessed it from the above statements).
             Tags are shown as "albums" under a subtree of the treeview on the left.
             Tagging can be done individually for an image using a dialog (enhanced version
             of  the old comments dialog) or in bulk by selecting a bunch of images and
             dragging and dropping on a tag.
          i) rewrite of the painting routines by getting information from the database
             diretly instead of loading it into memory. thumbnail items have a fixed
             grid size and text not fitting into the grid will be shown truncated with dots.
             (need to add a tooltip for this)
          f) extra information that can be shown in the thumbnail view:
             name (yes, name is hideable), date, file size, resolution, comments,
             jpeg comments, tags. removed items: Exif comments and mimetype
          g) lots more. i will add them to the ChangeLog as and when i remember them
        * cgilles (2004-06-23): Fixed TipOfDay slot
        * cgilles (2004-06-23): Extract the DigikamPlugins TipOfDays for LibKipi.
          Add a merging call of Digikam and Kipi TipsOfDays at the same time.
        * cgilles (2004-06-23): Update
        * cgilles (2004-06-19): Fix release number 0.6.3 -> 0.7.0
          Added ReadSettings method to kipiinterface.
        * cgilles (2004-06-18): [no log message]
        * cgilles (2004-06-16): Fix KIPI plugins category indentification in according
          with last libKIPI changes.
        * cgilles (2004-06-15): Changed plugins category identification in according with
          the last LibKIPI changes.
        * cgilles (2004-06-15): Updated the menu and popup menu in according with KIPI
          plugins actions. Added 'album_action' collection.
        * pahlibar (2004-06-14): make sure image resize dialog has the imagewindow as
          parent, so that it doesn't cause the imagewindow to bury itself when invoked
        * cgilles (2004-06-14): The Batch Processes KIPI plugins can be used now directly
          by the AlbumFolder popup menu.
        * cgilles (2004-06-14): Fixed KIPI plugins dynamic loading/unloading
        * pahlibar (2004-06-13):
          Shift-Wheel to move between images. Ctrl-Wheel to change zoom
        * pahlibar (2004-06-12):
          1) zoom in small steps 10% increments
          2) hold shift button and roll the wheel mouse to zoomin/out
        * pahlibar (2004-06-12):
          fixed minor painting issue with the selection rectangle
        * pahlibar (2004-06-12):
         alpha blended selection for smooth selections unlike the last
         cross-hatched pattern from qpainter.
        * pahlibar (2004-06-12):
          1) Bump up the delay for smooth painting a bit in imageeditor
          2) add album title as caption for the imageeditor
          3) add first and last buttons to the toolbar in the imageeditor
        * pahlibar (2004-06-12): imageeditor selection gets resize handles.
        * pahlibar (2004-06-11):
          1) Zooming should be much faster (and use considerably less memory at
          large zooms). rendering done in two phases: a sub-super-pixel sampled
          scaled one first and with a qtimer timeout an antialiased scaled one.
          we take advantage of imlib2 speed (and cache use) and render from image
          to pixmap for every repaint. only exposed area is rendered unlike
          previously where the entire image was rendered to a cached pixmap.

          2) fix 2 of the bugs reported by  Mikolaj Machowski:
            a) space between resolution and "pixels"
            b) imageviewer being pushed back behind main app when a plugin
               dialog opens
        * rhoezler (2004-06-11): Implement Libkexif changes (writing EXIF data without
          reading it).
        * rhoezler (2004-06-08): Make it compile after Libkexif change.
        * pahlibar (2004-06-08): minor performance optimizations. don't render to mask
          unless image has alpha
        * pahlibar (2004-06-08):
          Cleaned up the imageplugin interface. hopefully should be easier to program for.
          enable selection based image plugin actions (eg. redeye) only if a selection
          is made
        * pahlibar (2004-06-07):
          first set of digikam imageeditor plugins:
          1) adjust brightness/contrast/gamma
          2) convert to black & white
          3) convert to sepia (too strong a sepia cast now. need to fix this)
          4) solarizing plugin
          5) redeye correction plugin.
        * pahlibar (2004-06-07):
          new imageeditor merge. old imageviewer still retained (not compiled though,
          till all the functions are ported).
          New features:
          1) ported to imlib2
          2) new gui - based on qmainwindow with menubar and toolbar
          3) plugin interface so that image editor plugins can be written externally
          4) native dynamic gui builder instead of xmlgui for performance reasons.
          5) new selection method
          6) new resize image option
        * rhoezler (2004-06-07): - Check for and use Libkexif from kdeextra-libs-1 now for
          Digikam. Building digikam/utilities/kexif is disabled, but I won't remove the
          files until we're sure it doesn't cause any problems.
        * cgilles (2004-06-07): Enable kipi plugins support on configure script by default.
        * rhoezler (2004-06-07): - Load KIPI plugins via loadPlugins() again
          - Pass entire path to plugin, not just image name
        * rhoezler (2004-06-06): - Prevent digikam from crashing, if it could not get a plugin.
        * rhoezler (2004-06-06): - Make digikam compile with the lateset libkipi changes
        * pahlibar (2004-06-02):
          prevent thumbnail kioslave from crashing, if the imlib2 imageloader is
          not able to return image data
        * pahlibar (2004-06-02):
          more subdued highlighting for thumbnails.
          load the metainfo only if its requested (showing the initial screen with
          filenames and empty thumbnails should be much faster now if file comments
          and/or resolution is not requested). fix memory leak if file metainfo is
          requested multiple times.
          in setup warn users that above two makes things slower.

v0.6.0-RC        11/27/03
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
        * Added plugins submenu 'Transform' in 'images' main menu.
        * Added Czech and Hungarian i18n.
        * Removed jpeglossless code from main application. Moved to a plugin
        * Added kioslave based thumbnail generation code. there were
          problems with the threaded version and some qt/kde versions.
        * Drag and drop copy/move of images between albums will also copy/move
          comments. these use wrappers around kde kio classes to move/copy
          comments along with the files
        * Plugins can merge their actions into the right-click menu of the
          thumbnailview by just adding "X-Digikam-MergeMenu=true" in their
          desktop file
        * Removed a source of flicker in the albumiconview
        * Thumbnail Generator added to interfaces. more robust (with
          jpeg error checking - thanks to Marcus Meissner) and simpler to
          use (using signals/slots). Provides a non-blocking thumbnail
          generation interface compliant with freedesktop.org
          standards (which is used by the main application and also can be
          used by any of the plugins).
        * Now instead of download to directory in the cameraclient, we
          have download to album. also new albums can be created directly
          from the cameraclient.
        * Fixed selection problem in albumfolderview in case of DnD.
        * Fixed a bug in Album::getPath() API plugins implementation.
        * Plugins can refresh the view if they change the comments of the items.
        * Now, the album library is the only place where you add or delete albums.
        * All the information for an album (collection,date,comments) and for the
          items in the album (currently only comments) are stored in a single xml
          file ( called digikam.xml ) inside the album itself.
        * Now albums are directly detected in the album library path, no need
          for manual addition and deletion.
        * The comments.xml file has been changed to digikam.xml and its format
          also has changed.
        * Added a doxyfile to generate documentation for the plugin API.
        * Now we have a new clean API and its well documented.
        * Fix 3 no named actions for image rotation in Digikam.
        * Improve shorcuts rendering in documentation.
        * Add 'Selection' menu actions in Digikam.
